                    PNW Beak Beacon started with a joke. A group of novice programmers were brainstorming what site to create when an offhand comment about a profile picture led to conversing seriously about exploring a way for people to share their love of Pacific Northwest Birds. We've compiled a database that will allow people to share locations where birders can share their sightings with the bird-watching community.

                    Our website enables bird-watching enthusiasts to log their personal bird sightings and share them with the community. These sightings will be pinpointed onto a map that others can then look at if they're trying to see what's around, or search for something specifically. We have also included a database that will allow bird-watchers to search for a specific bird and then pull up the information for what to look for and where in the Pacific Northwest.
